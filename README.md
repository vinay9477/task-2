  - Enhanced readability across devices.

  - Created a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for mobile.  
  - Smooth transition between expanded and collapsed states.

* **Accessibility** – A responsive design ensures inclusivity for all device users.  
* **SEO Benefits** – Search engines prioritize responsive websites.  
* **Consistency** – The same website can serve users without the need for a separate mobile version.

  - **Solution**: Scalable typography and flexible layouts.  

* **Challenge**: Navigation collapsing properly.  
  - **Solution**: Added JavaScript toggles and CSS transitions.
